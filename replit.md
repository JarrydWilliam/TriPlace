# TriPlace - Social Platform

## Overview

TriPlace is a full-stack social platform that connects people through shared experiences, communities, and events. Built with a modern tech stack, it features a React frontend with Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and Firebase for authentication.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)

### Project Structure

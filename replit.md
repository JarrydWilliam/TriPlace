- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)

### Project Structure

# TriPlace WebView Mobile Deployment Guide

## What is WebView Implementation?
A WebView wraps your existing TriPlace web application inside a native mobile container. You're not rebuilding anything - just loading your website as the app's interface.

## Files Ready for Deployment

### 1. WebView Container (`webview.html`)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript wrapper
- Loads your TriPlace app in an iframe
- Mobile-optimized with touch handling
- Prevents zoom, overscroll, and context menus
- Includes loading states and error handling

### 2. Mobile-Optimized Web App
All pages now include:
- `mobile-page-container` CSS class for smooth scrolling
- `overscroll-behavior: none` to prevent bounce effects
- Enhanced touch targets (44px minimum)
- WebView-specific optimizations

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct WebView Deployment
1. Use `webview.html` as your mobile app's main interface
2. Point the iframe src to your deployed Replit URL
3. Package with Cordova, PhoneGap, or similar wrapper

### Option 2: Native App Integration
```javascript
// For React Native WebView
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

<WebView 
  source={{ uri: 'https://your-replit-url.repl.co' }}
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  javaScriptEnabled={true}
  domStorageEnabled={true}
  startInLoadingState={true}
  scalesPageToFit={false}
  scrollEnabled={true}
  bounces={false}
  originWhitelist={['*']}
/>
```

### Option 3: PWA Installation
Your app already includes:
- `manifest.webmanifest` for app installation
- Service worker for offline capabilities
- PWA installation prompt component

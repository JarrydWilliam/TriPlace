Expected Behavior
Communities should be:

Relevant to the user’s actual geolocation (e.g. city or region from device/browser).

Generic in name unless hyper-local is intended (e.g. “Introverts Who Hike” vs. “Bay Area Hikers”).

Consistent with user's quiz interests, not defaulting to SF or any static area.

❌ Current Problem
AI-generated communities are specific to San Francisco, even when your dashboard shows the correct location.

This usually happens when:

The API has a fallback to a static location (often hardcoded or set in the training).

Geolocation isn't being passed correctly during the quiz or community matching call.

There's a mismatch between frontend geolocation and backend AI input.

🔍 Debug Checklist
1. Check Where the Location Is Captured
Ensure you’re actually capturing the user’s location in the app before quiz submission or community generation:

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => {
    const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
    // Save to state or context
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error('Geolocation error:', error);
    // fallback location?
  }
);
2. Confirm It's Passed to the API
When calling the OpenAI agent or backend that generates communities, include:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "interests": [...],
  ...
}
✅ Best practice: reverse geocode the coordinates to city/state using a service like OpenCage, [Google Maps API], or even OpenStreetMap Nominatim before you hit the AI endpoint.

3. Adjust Prompting Logic
If the OpenAI Agent is being fed a system message or initial context like:

"Generate 5 communities in the San Francisco area based on interests..."

💥 That needs to be replaced with:

"Generate 5 communities based on the user's interests and their current location: {city}, {state}. If the location is unavailable, generate general interest-based communities."

✅ What to Do Now
✅ Fix in Your Frontend:
Make sure navigator.geolocation is called and sent with quiz responses.

✅ Fix in Your Agent or Backend:
Modify your API call or prompt to dynamically inject the user’s city/region.

If no location is provided, fallback to general (non-geographic) community names.

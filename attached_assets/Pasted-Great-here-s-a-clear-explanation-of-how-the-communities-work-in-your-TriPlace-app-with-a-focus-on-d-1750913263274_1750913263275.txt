Great—here's a clear explanation of how the communities work in your TriPlace app, with a focus on dynamic membership, fixed titles, geolocation filtering, and how it all ties into the quiz logic:

🧠 How TriPlace Communities Work
🔹 1. Community Titles Are Static
Each community has a universal title based on:

Hobbies (e.g., "Trail Runners", "Indie Music Fans")

Interests (e.g., "AI Enthusiasts", "Craft Coffee Drinkers")

Life experiences or aspirations (e.g., "First-Time Travelers", "Local Entrepreneurs")

Example: The "Sunset Hikers" community always exists, no matter where the user is.

🔹 2. Membership Is Dynamic Based on Location and Quiz Match
Each user only sees:

Members within a 50-mile radius

Who have at least 70% interest overlap from the onboarding quiz

This keeps communities hyper-local and highly relevant.

When your location updates:

New nearby users with similar quiz responses automatically appear in your communities

Distant users phase out (but you don't lose access to the community itself)

🔹 3. How the System Works (Behind the Scenes)
📌 Step 1: Quiz Results = User Tags
Each user gets tags like:

["hiking", "live music", "vegan", "startup-founder"]

📌 Step 2: GPS or IP-Based Location
The app stores:

Latitude & longitude (via device GPS or IP fallback)

City/region name

Last updated timestamp

📌 Step 3: Match Logic
For each community:

Community = Topic (e.g., “Night Runners” = running, evening, fitness)

Users are matched if:

They’re within 50 miles

Their tags match the topic with ≥70% similarity

They are currently active or recently online

📌 Step 4: Dynamic Feed and Messaging
The Live Chat, community feed, and events:

Are shown only between local matched users

Will update automatically if you travel or your interests change

🌀 Example: A Real User Experience
User A (NYC) and User B (Brooklyn) both join "Creative Coders":

They’re within 10 miles

Both listed "creative coding", "web3", "UX design" in their quiz
✅ → They can message and see each other

User C (Chicago) also joins "Creative Coders", but:

Outside the 50-mile range of User A
🚫 → They don’t see each other, even though the title is the same

When User A flies to LA:

Their community stays "Creative Coders"

Members update to LA-based creatives

The feed adapts to local posts/events

COMMUNITY TABS: FULL FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
💡 What Are the Communities Tabs?
These are dynamic, personalized spaces that reflect the user’s interests, behaviors, and location-based social circles.

Each community is:

Themed (e.g. “Outdoor Explorers”, “Runners & Hikers”, “Swifties”, “Foodie Adventures”)

Automatically populated based on:

Quiz results (past, present, future interests)

Events attended

Current location (within 50 miles)

70%+ interest match with other users

🧭 JOINING A COMMUNITY
✅ How Users Get Communities
Automatically joined to 3–5 communities post-quiz.

Can discover and join additional communities via:

Suggested cards on the home dashboard

“Explore Communities” tab

Attending community events

Users never apply to communities — they are matched by system.

📍 Location-Aware Membership
Members inside each community change dynamically based on geolocation.

If no high-matching members within 50 miles, system expands to 100 miles.

Communities retain their title/identity, but the people inside shift.

🧩 COMMUNITY TAB CONTENTS
When a user enters a Community Tab, they see:

🧵 1. Live Messaging Feed
Real-time group chat (MS Teams-style).

Posts show:

"Resonate" (like) button

📅 2. Community Event Panel

🧍 3. Member Highlights

🔄 COMMUNITY UPDATING LOGIC
✅ Adaptive Membership System
Back-end reevaluates memberships based on:

Location change

Event attendance

Quiz update

Communities feel stable in purpose, fresh in people.

❗No Manual Exiting Needed
Users don’t have to leave communities.

If interest or location changes, membership updates passively.

⚙️ EXTRA TECH NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Each community = its own ID in DB.

User profile has array of joined communities (joinedCommunities)

Match algorithm runs:

On signup (after quiz)

On location update

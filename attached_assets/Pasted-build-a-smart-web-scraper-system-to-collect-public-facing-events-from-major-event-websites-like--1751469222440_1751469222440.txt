build a smart web scraper system to collect public-facing events from major event websites like:

✅ Meetup

✅ Eventbrite

✅ Ticketmaster

✅ Facebook Events (limited scraping possible)

✅ *Local event blogs, university calendars, city websites, etc.

And then automatically populate your community’s Events tab, based on your criteria such as:

🔧 How It Works (System Overview)
1. Source Scrapers (Modular Bots)
Each site has its own scraper script, built using:

Puppeteer, Playwright (for dynamic pages)

Cheerio, axios (for static HTML)

BeautifulSoup (for Python)

Each scraper extracts:

Title

Date/Time

Location

Tags / Categories

Event link

Image

Organizer info (if possible)

✅ We make them modular, so each website has its own handler and you can easily plug new ones in.

2. Filter Engine
Before inserting into your database, the system checks:

✅ Event location matches the user’s community geo

✅ Category/tags match the community topic

✅ Time is upcoming

✅ Not already in DB (use hash/ID to deduplicate)

Optional:

🧠 AI scoring (e.g., GPT or embedding match) to boost relevance.

3. Backend Ingest & Mapping
Once filtered:

Events are stored in your DB (e.g., PostgreSQL)

Linked to the correct Community ID based on:

Location

Topic/hobby tags

Partner/pinned status

4. Display in Events Tab
Your frontend queries the /api/events?communityId=xyz endpoint to render events per community tab.

✅ Benefits
Fully automated — no user input needed

Dynamic and constantly updating

Highly relevant (based on tags, location, date)

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Note
Only public data should be scraped (visible without login)

Always respect robots.txt and avoid overloading servers

For commercial use, consider APIs where possible (like Eventbrite’s)

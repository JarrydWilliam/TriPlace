 Core Functional Setup
Task	Description	Status
✅ Firebase Auth	Google Sign-In + email/password flows configured in Firebase Console	✔️ Working
🔲 Firebase Firestore Rules	Ensure database security rules restrict access by auth state	🔁 Double-check
🔲 Firebase Hosting or Vercel/Netlify	Set up CI/CD deployment target	⚠️ Needed
✅ Environment Variables	.env file contains Firebase credentials, API endpoints	✔️ Present
🔲 Supabase (if used)	Ensure if Supabase is present, the auth + DB logic isn't redundant	⚠️ Review if mixed usage

🧱 2. File & Project Structure Review
File Group	Requirement	Notes
src/pages/	Home, Landing, Quiz, Dashboard, Communities	✔️ Present
src/components/	Shared UI, Navigation, Cards, Toast, Chat Input	✔️ Good
src/lib/	API calls, utility functions (queryClient.ts, etc.)	✔️ Complete
tailwind.config.ts	Mobile breakpoints, dark/light mode classes	⚠️ Add safe area padding (pt-safe, etc.)
index.html	Mobile responsive meta tags	⚠️ Add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
vite.config.ts	Correct path aliases (@/) + PWA plugin	✔️ Appears OK

🎨 3. Design & Responsiveness
Task	Description	Status
✅ Dark/Light mode toggle	Implemented via Tailwind class toggle	✔️
🔲 Mobile layouts	Home, Dashboard, Chat must use flex-col, overflow-y-auto	⚠️ Needs scroll fixes
🔲 Scrollable calendar	Events calendar must scroll properly on mobile	⚠️
✅ Chat input pinned	Message input at bottom of screen	✔️ Works but validate on all screen sizes
🔲 Component padding	Avoid header/footer overlays (safe area padding)	⚠️ Add padding for notch support

🔒 4. Authentication Flow
Step	Goal	Notes
✅ Google sign-in	Opens popup (fix was made)	✔️ Test across browsers
🔲 Redirect on login	From Landing → Quiz → Dashboard	⚠️ Validate quiz redirect logic
✅ Real-time auth	Firebase onAuthStateChanged implemented	✔️ Confirmed
✅ Logout functionality	Button exists on profile/settings page	✔️ Confirmed

📍 5. Geolocation + Community Filtering
Task	Description	Status
✅ Get current location	navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() used	✔️ Present
🔲 Filter communities/events	Based on 50-mile radius, fallback to 100 if empty	⚠️ Review query logic for fallback
🔲 User data integration	Save lat/long to user profile (for querying)	⚠️ Needed for dynamic filtering
🔲 Event discovery APIs	Not fully integrated (consider Eventbrite, Ticketmaster, PredictHQ)	🚧 Planned

📋 6. Quiz System Logic
Task	Description	Status
✅ Quiz Page exists	Questionnaire logic is working	✔️ Present
🔲 Store results	Save to user profile to match communities	⚠️ Tie to Firestore or backend
🔲 AI recommendation	Dynamic community generation based on responses	🧠 Optional (post-MVP)

🧼 7. Final QA Before Launch
Category	Checks
✅ No broken routes	Test all routing (Landing → Quiz → Home → Communities)
✅ No missing components	All imports working, NotFound fallback added
✅ Toast/Loading feedback	All async actions (login, post, create event) show UI feedback
🔲 404 / Edge case handling	Catch missing community ID, invalid user session, API errors
✅ Firebase rules	Prevent unauthenticated access to /events, /posts
🔲 App icon / favicon	Ensure mobile icon + PWA manifest setup
🔲 Hosting configs	For Vercel or Netlify: vite.config.ts, 404.html, _redirects

📱 8. Optional PWA Enhancements
Task	Description
✅ PWA support present	PWAUpdateManagerFixed.tsx, service worker registered
🔲 Add manifest.json	Define app name, icons, theme color
🔲 Test offline behavior	Load home/dashboard offline and handle fallback gracefully

Phase 1: Project Setup & Local Testing
✅ 1. Stack
Backend: Node.js (Express or minimal HTTP)

Database: Firebase Firestore (or Supabase/PostgreSQL)

Scheduler: Cron job via node-cron or Replit's built-in scheduler

Scraping Tool: Axios + Cheerio (or Puppeteer if needed)

Hosting: Replit or Vercel for frontend, Render or Railway for backend scraper

✅ 2. Local Setup
Test your scrapers locally with mock URLs.

Use .env for API keys and configuration.

Store events temporarily in a local JSON or mock DB to verify format.

⚙️ Phase 2: Automation & Matching Logic
✅ 3. Schedule Scraper Jobs
Use node-cron to run scrapers every 4–6 hours:

js
Copy
Edit
const cron = require("node-cron");
cron.schedule("0 */6 * * *", () => runScraper());
✅ 4. Event Processing Logic
Match events to communities based on:

Tags

Title keywords

Geo-radius (via geolocation.js)

Relevance score

✅ 5. Firebase Integration (Sample)
js
Copy
Edit
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
const db = getFirestore();

await addDoc(collection(db, "events"), {
  title: "SF Startup Meetup",
  date: "2025-07-10",
  communityId: "ai-founders",
  pinned: false,
  location: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 }
});
☁️ Phase 3: Deployment
✅ 6. Host Scraper Backend
Railway.app: Easy auto-deployment from GitHub + cron support

Render.com: Supports background jobs and scheduled tasks

Replit: Works but cron may require constant uptime workaround

✅ 7. Endpoint (Optional)
Provide a REST API for events:

ts
Copy
Edit
GET /api/events?communityId=xyz
Filters by community and returns pre-matched/pinned events for display.

🛡️ Phase 4: Monitoring & Maintenance
✅ 8. Error Handling
Add try/catch with logging to console or Sentry

Notify on failed scrapes via webhook or email

✅ 9. Rate Limit / Proxy
Use a proxy or rotating user-agent headers to avoid bans

For heavy scraping: integrate with ScraperAPI or BrightData

🧪 Phase 5: Frontend Integration
✅ 10. Events Tab
Automatically load events from /events endpoint or Firebase

Sort by datetime, 

populate events tab calendar

Allow user to click into event on calander and show event details

give capability to join event on event detail page, and have the event populate to user dashboard calander with events that have been joined

Core Logic & Behavior
1. Titles Stay the Same, Members Change
Each user has a fixed set of community "themes" (titles) such as:

Runners & Racers

Tech Curious

Live Music Fans

Fitness & Flow

Nature Seekers

These titles are generated by quiz results and interests never have location specific wording like "San Francisco, Boston... etc.". The member list inside each community changes based on:

✅ A 70%+ interest match

📍 Location within 50 miles (expand to 100 miles if no match)

⏱ Active users only (last login/activity considered)

2. Real-Time Membership Updates
When a user’s location changes or interests evolve:

Communities update automatically

Members enter and leave communities dynamically

This keeps the experience fresh, localized, and relevant

## Overview
Your TriPlace app is now ready for native mobile deployment using Expo and React Native WebView. The mobile app wraps your Replit-hosted web application in a native shell for iOS and Android.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] All demo data removed from database
- [x] User data completely cleared for clean start
- [x] Desktop-specific parameters removed
- [x] Mobile-first CSS optimizations applied
- [x] Native mobile app structure created
- [x] WebView integration with GPS location services
- [x] Firebase authentication working across web and mobile

## Mobile App Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Expo CLI
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
```

### 2. Configure Your Replit URL
Update `mobile/App.js` line 11:
```javascript
const replitUrl = 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-REPLIT-URL.repl.co';
```
Replace with your live Replit deployment URL.

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

### 4. Test Locally
```bash
npx expo start
```
- Scan QR code with Expo Go app (iOS/Android)
- Test all features work in mobile WebView

## Firebase Configuration for Mobile

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build for both platforms
eas build --platform all

# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform all
```

### Alternative: Expo Application Services
1. Create Expo account
2. Configure app.json with your bundle identifiers
